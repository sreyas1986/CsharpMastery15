# SystemDesign_AuditLogger
System design notes for Audit Logger
Absolutely, Sreyas. Here's a structured and BFSI-grade system design sketch for an **Audit Logger**—tailored for high-compliance domains like banking, fintech, and regulated enterprise platforms.

---

## 🏗️ SystemDesign_AuditLogger  
**Purpose:** Capture, store, and query audit events across microservices for traceability, compliance, and fraud detection.

### 🔹 1. **Core Requirements**

| Category         | Details                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Functional**   | Log API access, data changes, authentication events, and system actions |
| **Non-Functional** | High availability, low latency, secure, scalable, tamper-proof         |
| **Compliance**   | PCI-DSS, GDPR, RBI, ISO 27001                                           |

### 🔹 2. **Architecture Overview**

```
[Microservices] → [Audit SDK] → [Audit Queue] → [Audit Processor] → [Audit Store]
                                        ↓
                                  [Alert Engine]
```

- **Audit SDK**: Lightweight client lib for emitting structured audit events
- **Audit Queue**: Kafka / Azure Event Hub for decoupled ingestion
- **Audit Processor**: .NET Worker Service for validation, enrichment, persistence
- **Audit Store**: Write-optimized DB (e.g., PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB or MongoDB)
- **Alert Engine**: Optional rules engine for triggering fraud alerts

---

### 🔹 3. **Audit Event Schema**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-28T10:55:00Z",
  "actor": "user:12345",
  "action": "PAYMENT_INITIATED",
  "resource": "txn:98765",
  "ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "metadata": {
    "amount": 5000,
    "channel": "mobile",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

- **Immutable**: No updates allowed post-write
- **Signed**: Optional HMAC for tamper detection
- **Partitioned**: By date, actor, or resource

---

### 🔹 4. **Tech Stack (Recommended)**

| Layer              | Tech Choices                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| SDK                | .NET 8, C#, Polly for retries                  |
| Queue              | Kafka, Azure Event Hub                         |
| Processor          | .NET Worker Service, Serilog, OpenTelemetry    |
| Store              | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB / MongoDB             |
| Search             | ElasticSearch / Azure Cognitive Search         |
| Alerting           | Rule engine (Drools / custom DSL)              |

---

### 🔹 5. **Security & Compliance**

- ✅ TLS 1.2+ for transport
- ✅ Role-based access to audit search APIs
- ✅ Data encryption at rest (AES-256)
- ✅ Tamper detection via HMAC or blockchain hash chaining
- ✅ Retention policies (e.g., 7 years for RBI compliance)

---

### 🔹 6. **Query API Design**

```http
GET /audit?actor=user:12345&from=2025-09-01&to=2025-09-28
```

- Supports pagination, filtering by actor/resource/action
- Optional export to CSV/PDF for compliance teams

---

### 🔹 7. **Scalability Patterns**

- 🔄 Async ingestion via queue
- 🧵 Batch writes with upserts
- 🧠 Indexing on actor/resource/timestamp
- 🧊 Cold storage for older logs (e.g., Azure Blob Archive)

---

### 🔹 8. **Interview-Ready STAR Impact**

> “I designed a BFSI-grade audit logger using .NET 8 and Kafka, capable of ingesting 10K+ events/sec with tamper-proof storage and OpenTelemetry tracing. It reduced compliance audit turnaround by 80% and flagged 3 fraud patterns via rule-based alerts.”

Would you like me to convert this into a GitHub README, add sample code for the SDK, or sketch out xUnit tests for the processor?
